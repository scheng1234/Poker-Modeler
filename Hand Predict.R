#   Work backwards and try to figure out what's left of "Deck" and try to pick
#   out best hand. Want to get out Chance of getting FH or Straight | what information we know.
#
# ===========================

# {Set of 52}
# {Draw 2, n players}
# {Deck = Set of 52 elements of 2*n (known only)}
# We probably won't know what cards were taken. We'll have to "Math it out" for possible cards
#
# {n1, n2, n_x}
# { fill n_x with best cards}
# { n_x exist in Deck?}
